# Minerva

## For Additional Information, Please Read the Project READMEs

Welcome to my comprehensive project that seamlessly integrates three key components: an HTTPS server, a tracker, and the Minerva mobile app. Together, these elements form a robust tracking system. For additional information read the readmes of the projects.

# HTTPS Server

THe HTTPS server offers two implementations, in Go and C++, catering to both ESP32 and regular server.

# Minerva: Mobile App for Tracker Configuration and Navigation

Minerva, the mobile app, provides an intuitive interface for tracking and configuring your devices. It allows monitoring of the tracker's location, displays extended information, and enables modification of settings directly from the app. The minerva readme contains details on building, deploying, and prerequisites.

# Tracker

The tracker, powered by an ESP32, gathers and transmits data to our HTTPS server. Additional hardware components include NEO-6M and SIM800L (optional, not yet implemented).
